# Kaggle Notebooks Portfolio

This repository contains my machine learning and data analysis projects
built using Kaggle datasets. Each project follows a structured workflow
including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering,
modeling, validation, and interpretation.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical problem-solving
skills, clean project organization, and real-world machine learning
techniques using Python.
