# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for handwritten digit
recognition using the MNIST dataset and the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition format.

## Overview
- Task: Multi-class image classification (digits 0–9)
- Dataset: Digit Recognizer (Kaggle)
- Models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

## Workflow
1. Data understanding and visualization
2. Data preprocessing (normalization and reshaping)
3. CNN model building and training with EarlyStopping
4. Model evaluation using validation accuracy
5. Generation of Kaggle submission file

## Results
- Validation Accuracy: ~98.95%
- CNN Test Accuracy (MNIST-style): ~99.1%
