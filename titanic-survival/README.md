# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict
passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. The workflow includes data
cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, Random Forest
modeling, regularization, cross-validation, and feature importance analysis.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster
- Rows: 891
- Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (FamilySize, IsAlone)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Model Regularization
- Cross-Validation
- Feature Importance Analysis

## Results
- Cross-validated accuracy: ~81.7%
- Reduced overfitting with stable generalization
