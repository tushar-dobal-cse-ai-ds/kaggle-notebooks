# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting
customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

The project demonstrates data cleaning, preprocessing, encoding, feature
engineering, model training and evaluation, and interpretation of results
from a business perspective.

## Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
2. **One-Hot Encoding of Categorical Features**  
3. **Feature Scaling**  
4. **Model Training (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)**  
5. **ROC-AUC Evaluation and Confusion Matrix Analysis**  
6. **Threshold Optimization for Better Churn Recall**  
7. **Business Insight and Interpretation**

## Final Model Performance

- **Logistic Regression**
  - Accuracy: ~80%
  - ROC-AUC: ~0.835
  - Churn Recall: ~57%

## Libraries Used

- numpy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn
