## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from grayscale images using deep learning.

The model is built using:
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- MNIST-style dataset (28×28 pixel images)

---

## 🧠 Model Highlights

- Multiple Conv2D layers
- MaxPooling layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully connected Dense layers
- Softmax output layer
- Achieved >99% validation accuracy
