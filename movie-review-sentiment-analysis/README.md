# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning

This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for movie review sentiment
classification using the IMDb dataset. The workflow includes:

- Exploratory text data analysis
- Tokenization and sequence padding
- LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM model training
- Evaluation using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix

Final model achieved strong performance (~88–89% accuracy) using a Bidirectional LSTM
with GlobalMaxPooling, demonstrating deep learning text classification techniques.
