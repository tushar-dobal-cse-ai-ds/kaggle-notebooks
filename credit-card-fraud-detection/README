# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine
learning techniques on a highly imbalanced dataset.

## Workflow
- Data Understanding & EDA
- Preprocessing and Feature Scaling
- Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Advanced Evaluation (ROC-AUC, Precision–Recall)
- Class Imbalance Handling using SMOTE

## Results
- Random Forest + SMOTE achieved:
  - Fraud Recall: ~88%
  - ROC-AUC: ~0.98

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
